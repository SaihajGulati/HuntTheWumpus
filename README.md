# HuntTheWumpus
This is a complete Java game with more than 30 rooms and full theming built by Saihaj Gulati (Team Manager), Raj Sunku, Daniel Popa, Joshua Venable, Brian Yang, and Hans Koduri.
It was originally built when we were sophmores in high school in early 2019, and was uploaded to Github from Bitbucket on July 30, 2020 to make it publicly accessible.
