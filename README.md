# HuntTheWumpus
This is a complete Java game with more than 30 rooms and full theming built by Saihaj Gulati (Team Manager and Lead Developer), Raj Sunku, Daniel Popa, Joshua Venable, Brian Yang, and Hans Koduri. It placed as a runner-up at the 2019 Microsoft Hunt the Wumpus video game programming competition.
It was originally built when we were sophmores in high school in early 2019, and was uploaded to Github from Bitbucket on July 30, 2020 to make it publicly accessible. When we built the game, we took pride in the fact that we spent A LOT of time searching for bugs and adding overlooked polishing touches like being able to use the enter key to press ok buttons and saving game progress when you go to menu.
To play the game, download/clone the repository and run GameControl.java, which is the the start file. Tested and working in Eclipse and VS Code, but should work in any IDE.
